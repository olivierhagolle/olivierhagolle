###
I am a researcher at CESBIO laboratory in France.  My research is focused on optical time series of remote sensing images with a high resolution. I am the author of (MAJA multi-temporal cloud detection and atmospheric correction software)[https://labo.obs-mip.fr/multitemp/maccs-how-it-works/]. If you look at my codes, you will quickly find that regarding this aspect, I am an amateur.
